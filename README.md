Ingridients for Pizza 

1.Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.
2.For the dough: In a stand mixer with the paddle attachment, add the flour, yogurt and seasoning blend and mix until combined and tacky. Scrape off the dough from the paddle and replace the paddle with the kneading (dough hook) attachment. Sprinkle in a bit more flour and knead on medium until a ball forms. On a floured surface, roll out the dough to a big thin circle or divide the dough in half to make 2 pizzas.
3.For the toppings: Place the pizza on a baking sheet or pizza stone. Leaving a 1-inch border around the edge of the dough, top the pizza evenly with the sauce and cheese, then the selected toppings. Bake until the edges are golden brown, 8 to 12 minutes
